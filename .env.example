# Database Configuration
# Copy this file to .env if you want to customize settings

# Database name (optional, defaults to webapp_db)
#DB_NAME=webapp_db

# Database user (optional, defaults to wishkeeper)
#DB_USER=wishkeeper

# Database password (OPTIONAL - password-less auth enabled by default)
# Leave empty or unset for password-less authentication (recommended for Docker)
# Uses PostgreSQL trust authentication with network isolation for security
# For production with password auth, uncomment and set:
#DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here

# Note: Docker setup uses trust authentication by default (no password needed)
# This is secure because containers are isolated on a private network
